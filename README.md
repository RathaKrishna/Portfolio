## [Knight Spots](https://apps.apple.com/vg/app/knight-spots/id1461254489)

Knight Spots was a passion project of mine that I had when I started at the University of Central Florida. Noticing the plethora of students (and the limitation on all the parking spots) I decided to try and help my fellow Knights on campus by making finding a parking spot a little easier. Since the school already manages sensors at the garages I was able to recieve this data and parse it and create a ready to digest application for iOS. The biggest challenge that I faced when creating the app was understanding the use of delegates for passing data back and forth. I wanted the UI to change based on selected options and by adopting this pattern for data management I reduced the load on the view controllers.

#### Technologies used
* Written entirely with UIKit.
* Used Firebase realtime database for the backend.
* Data is populated using a Python script that intercepts and delivers the data to the database.
* App follows the MVC paradigm.
* Protocols and delegates play a big role in the functionality.
